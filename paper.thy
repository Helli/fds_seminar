section\<open>Introduction\<close>
text\<open>Two regular expressions (RE for short) are \<^emph>\<open>equivalent\<close>, if and only if they represent the
 same formal language, i.e.

  @{prop "lang r1 = lang r2"}

A well-known result from theoretical CS is that the problem of RE equivalence is decidable, meaning
that solving goals of the above form can be reduced to a mere computation. Thus, structured proofs
often don't add understanding: They should be replaced by a simple command, increasing
 readability and maintainability.
To prove decidability, most textbooks give this algorithm: Convert both REs into automata,
 determinize and minimize the result and check for equality (disregarding state identifiers).
 However, while
 this approach's correctness is obvious for CS graduates, verifying it is tedious, mostly because
 the formalization of automata theory requires a lot of notational overhead. Nipkow and Krauss@{cite
 "Krauss-Nipkow-JAR"} stress this complexity in their introduction, to motivate why they follow an
alternative approach due to Brzozowski@{cite Brzozowski}. The development results in a ready-to-use
 proof method@{cite "Regular-Sets-AFP"} in Isabelle/HOL, replacing 
 the need for manual derivation of RE equivalences. The
 avoiding of automata theory and Kleene-algebras leads to a much succincter proof than other verified
equivalent checkers for REs.

What could possibly lead to such a large simplification? The authors must have developed their new
concept  at some point after the \<^emph>\<open>Interactive Theorem Proving\<close> conference 2010 when Braibant and
 Pous@{cite "Braibant2010"} presented their tactic for the theorem prover coq. While their acquired
 algorithm is quite efficient and can handle arbitrary Kleene algebras, they need long and complex
 proofs for the verfication (about 19000 lines).
\<close>


subsection\<open>Simplicity\<close>
text\<open>Simplicity is of utmost importance for Isabelle: Not only are small, elegant proofs faster to
 re-run themselves (AFP is run several times a day to test conformance to the Isabelle development version),
  also the prover process does not need to load a huge chunk of code whenever it encounters a usage
 of the proof method: As we see later, we can shift the entire computation to the @{method eval}
 method, which probably resides in fast memory anyways during a lengthy build process.
\<close>


section\<open>About the reference article\<close>

text\<open>The purpose of the article@{cite "Krauss-Nipkow-JAR"} is to provide a new proof method for
  Isabelle/HOL. Users should not have to prove equivalence relations of REs
  themselves, but use a simple automatic command, saving time and work load. Ideally, this command should
 verify every correct equivalence, i.e. be complete (we don't worry about \<^bold>\<open>in\<close>equalities). However, as Nipkow
 writes, completeness "merely lets you sleep better". The reason is that proof methods are usually
 used interactively, and for small goals, meaning that a user can just \<^emph>\<open>try\<close> whether it solves the
 goal. He still argues why completeness holds (following a proof by Brzozowski@{cite "Brzozowski"}),
 but does not verify it.

Remember the definition

@{thm Deriv_def[no_vars]}

What remains to do, is to define a computable operation @{const nderiv} on REs which follows this
 equation:

text\<open>Remember that relations are just sets of pairs. Our method will incrementally add language
  pairs (represented by increasingly complex REs), maintaining the relation's
  bisimulation property. Once the examined regexes are added, equivalence for them is shown.\<close>

subsection\<open>Language Coinduction\<close>

text\<open>Consider the following lemma, which is proven by word-length induction:

@{thm [names_short] language_coinduct}

<todo: bisimulation(unten) vs. ~>

Thus, we can obtain an equivalence proof by establishing such a relation \<open>\<sim>\<close> (called \<open>bisimulation\<close>).

But first of course, the authors prove it:

  define ps' where "ps' = insert (Zero, Zero) ps"
  from bisim have bisim': "is_bisimulation as ps'"
    by (auto simp: ps'_def is_bisimulation_def)
  let ?R = "\<lambda>K L. (\<exists>(r,s)\<in>ps'. K = lang r \<and> L = lang s)"
  show ?thesis
  proof (rule language_coinduct[where R="?R"])
    from \<open>(r, s) \<in> ps\<close> 
    have "(r, s) \<in> ps'" by (auto simp: ps'_def)
    thus "?R (lang r) (lang s)" by auto
  next
    fix K L assume "?R K L"
    then obtain r s where rs: "(r, s) \<in> ps'"
      and KL: "K = lang r" "L = lang s" by auto
    with bisim' have "nullable r \<longleftrightarrow> nullable s"
      by (auto simp: is_bisimulation_def)
    thus "[] \<in> K \<longleftrightarrow> [] \<in> L" by (auto simp: nullable_iff KL)
    fix a
    show "?R (Deriv a K) (Deriv a L)"
    proof cases
      assume "a \<in> set as"
      with rs bisim'
      have "(nderiv a r, nderiv a s) \<in> ps'"
        by (auto simp: is_bisimulation_def)
      thus ?thesis by (force simp: KL lang_nderiv)
    next
      assume "a \<notin> set as"
      with bisim' rs
      have "a \<notin> atoms r" "a \<notin> atoms s" by (auto simp: is_bisimulation_def)

Other than that, special syntax is completely avoided: All connectives are represented
 with standard constructors (atoms need @{const Atom}, for instance).

text\<open>In the following, we will call a RE \<^emph>\<open>normed\<close> if
  \<^item> nested concatenation are parenthesised to the right
  \<^item> nested choices are also parenthesised to the right and also sorts them:
    Atoms first, then @{const Star}-terms, then concatenations
    (This order is arbitrary, but fixed).

The goal is that @{const nderiv} maintains this property, meaning that ACI-equivalent terms can be
identified.
\<close>
text
\<open>The first step of the equivalence checker must bring the input expressions into a normal form,
 such that ACI-equilavent terms map to the same normal form. It also performs other minor
 simplifications. The authors indicate the rough procedure for such a transformation, but omit
 implementation details. These are not relevant anyways: As long as @{thm lang_norm} is fulfilled (a
 simple structural induction proves it), errors at this step would not 
  lead to wrong results, but instead falsify completeness of the method (failing to identify
 ACI-equivalent terms could only falsify Brozozowksi' termination proof, for the partial correctness,
this is not needed).

  However, Verifying completeness is not necessary for an Isabelle proof method: In the unlikely
 case that the method hangs, a user could always just provide a structured proof in Isar.

(*Todo: Das n√§chste erst am Ende bei der Erkl√§rung vom main loop?*)
text\<open>
@{const norm} operates bottom up, defering Plus-terms and Times-terms to auxiliary functions
  which
  associate their subterms in a fixed manner.

  We will later also need this property:

  @{thm atoms_norm}

@{const nTimes} and @{const nPlus} are part of @{const
  norm}, working on already @{const norm}ed subterms.
 @{const nderiv} operates on @{const norm}ed terms output @{const norm}ed terms again. This fact is
 not needed for partial correctness, and therefore not verified.


 With the following definition of derivatives, we can proceed in the next section to describe the
 bisimulation:

@{thm nderiv.simps}

These rules are obviously designed to fulfill @{thm lang_nderiv}, which is shown by structural
 induction.

\<close>

section\<open>Bisimulation\<close>

text\<open>
The following defines a bisimulation restricted to a final set, making it computable. (We will later
 use the set of atoms in the initial expressions)

@{thm is_bisimulation_def}

It works like a certificate checker: given \<open>as\<close> and \<open>R\<close>, it tests whether the REs in
\<open>R\<close> contain only atoms in \<open>as\<close>, and describe a bisimulation according to section todo.

@{thm bisim_lang_eq}

<todo: Beweis gleich wie oben language-coinduct ? Sonst: Erkl√§rungen>
\<close>

text\<open>With this lemma, one could construct the bisimulation with an untrusted piece of code, and
 verify its result (\<open>R\<close>) afterwards, possibly gaining execution speed.
However, this extra effort is not needed: The following checks the bisimulation property
 on-the-fly, i.e. during its generation. Staying in the verified setting also helps unterstanding
 what's going on. Also, Isabelle-code is easier to maintain. Probably, the authors stay in the

text\<open>We only need \<open>\<subseteq>\<close> in the lemma @{thm atoms_nTimes}. Without the extra simplification in @{const
  nTimes}, we could prove \<open>=\<close>.\<close>

section\<open>Main loop\<close>

subsection\<open>Usage of @{const while_option}\<close>

text\<open>For purposes of the Logic (HOL being a logic of total functions) @{const while_option} always
 has a value associated with it: If no number of iterations falsifies the while-condition, this is
 @{const None}. However, the code generator is set up to only use the unfolding equation @{thm
 while_option_unfold}, meaning it works just like an imperative \<^emph>\<open>while\<close> would.
@{footnote \<open>@{cite "Krauss-Nipkow-JAR"}: "We want to define and reason about a closure computation without having to prove its
termination. For such situations, Isabelle's library defines a variant of the well-known
while combinator, which is called while-option. It takes a test \<open>b :: \<alpha> \<Rightarrow> bool\<close>, a function
\<open>c :: \<alpha> \<Rightarrow> \<alpha>\<close>, and a "state" \<open>s :: \<alpha>\<close>, and obeys the recursion equation

@{thm while_option_unfold}"
\<close>
}\<close>

subsection\<open>Closure computation\<close>
text\<open>
A specialisation for computing the transitive closure (which is exactly what we want) is already
  available in @{theory While_Combinator} as @{const rtrancl_while}, which operates



Note that this is just the computation of the transitive closure of \<open>R\<close> w.r.t @{const
 nderiv}, i.e. the smallest set \<open>R' \<supseteq> R\<close> s.t. \<open>\<And>r1 r2 r3. (r1,r2) \<in> R' \<Longrightarrow> (r2,r3) \<in> R' \<Longrightarrow> (r1,r3) \<in> R'\<close>.
 Thus, it can be expressed using the library's @{const rtrancl_while}, which 
 is how it is done as of AFP 2017@{cite "Regular-Sets-AFP"}.


Note that there are more efficient ways to compute the transitive closure@{cite
 "Transitive-Closure-AFP"}@{cite "Roy_Floyd_Warshall-AFP"}, but for the small goals that arise in
 interactive proofs, this is not needed.
